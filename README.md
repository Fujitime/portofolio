# **Hi, Senpaiüëã**
I am **Andika Nur Pratama**, a student who has an endless passion for programming. I am constantly amazed by the power of programming and the incredible things that can be built with just a few lines of code.

for me programming is like magic, there are so many things that I can't believe happened in the programming world.

My favorite thing is reading, studying, and modifying other people's code to make it even better. Whenever I work on programming projects, I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills. The process of learning from and building upon the work of others is incredibly rewarding and helps me to grow as a programmer.
